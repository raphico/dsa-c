# Data Structures & Algorithms in C

This repository is my **foundational DSA playground**. Iâ€™m building all core data structures and algorithms **from scratch in C** to deeply understand memory, pointers, and runtime complexity

## Why C?

- Zero abstractions: you manage memory directly (`malloc`, `free`).
- Forces a deep understanding of how data is laid out in memory.
- Classic CS: most textbooks map naturally to C.
